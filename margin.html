            <p>The DIVISION tag defines a division or a section in an HTML document.
The DIVISION tag is used as a container for HTML elements - which is then styled with CSS or manipulated with JavaScript.
            The DIVISION tag is easily styled by using the class or id attribute.
                 Any sort of content can be put inside the DIVISION tag! </p>
