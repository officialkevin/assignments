            <h1>DIVISION TAG DEFINITION</h1>
            <p>The DIVISION tag defines a division or a section in an HTML document.

                The DIVISION tag is used as a container for HTML elements - which is then styled with CSS or manipulated with JavaScript.
                
                The DIVISION tag is easily styled by using the class or id attribute.
                
                Any sort of content can be put inside the DIVISION tag! </p>

    <h2>How To Use the HTML Content Division Element</h2>
    <p>The HTML Content Division element acts as a container to structure a webpage into separate components for individual styling. This tutorial will teach you how to create and style containers on your webpage.
        On its own, the element has little effect on the layout of the page and 
        is usually given attributes to adjust its size, color, position, or other features.
         Typically, developers style elements with CSS, but this tutorial will give you an understanding 
         of how elements work by styling them directly in an HTML document.</p>
